# Chicago-Divvy-Dataset
Divvy is Chicago's bike share system, with 580 stations and 5,800 bikes across Chicagoland. Itâ€™s a fun, affordable and convenient way to get around.

Here, I tried to explore the dataset using different visualizations and then predicted the trip duration using the attributes found from feature importance.
